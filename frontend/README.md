```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-api-url
```

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start local dev server (Vite) |
| `npm run build` | Build production-ready static files |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint to check code style |

---

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Notes

- Designed with **reusability and clean code principles** to optimize both performance and developer experience.  
- Uses **modular architecture**: shared components, stores, and hooks are generic and easy to extend.  
- **Responsive UI** powered by Tailwind + shadcn ensures consistent design across devices.
