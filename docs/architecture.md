## System Overview

The Log Management System (LMS) is a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to collect, process, store, and analyze log data from various sources. The system provides real-time log ingestion, powerful search capabilities, customizable dashboards, and intelligent alerting mechanisms.

### Key Features
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Secure data isolation between organizations
- **Real-time Log Ingestion**: Support for multiple log formats and protocols
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search with filtering and aggregation
- **Custom Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations and metrics
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Rule-based notifications with multiple channels
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permissions management

## Component Details

### 1. Data Sources
This system can collect logs from multiple sources such as firewalls, networks, HTTP APIs, CrowdStrike, AWS CloudTrail, Microsoft 365, and Active Directory. This flexibility ensures that both security and application events can be centralized into one platform.

### 2. Ingestion Layer
The ingestion layer has three main entry points: a Syslog receiver for UDP/TCP logs, an HTTP API for JSON logs, and a file batch processor for CSV or JSON files (Note: CSV ingestion is planned but not yet implemented only JSON is supported). Logs go through a normalization engine which maps fields into a unified schema, validates formats, and tags them with the correct tenant.

### 3. Processing & Storage Layer
- **Search Engine**: Logs are indexed to support fast full-text search and time-based queries.
- **Alert Engine**: Rules are continuously evaluated, and alerts are sent via email or webhook if thresholds are met.
- **Data Retention**: Logs are automatically cleaned up after seven days to save storage and enforce isolation per tenant.
- **Job Queue & Workers**: BullMQ handles background tasks such as sending emails, refreshing cache, OTP delivery, and running alert jobs with reliable retries.
- **Caching Layer**: Redis is used for query caching, which reduces load on the database and improves performance.
- **Database Storage**: PostgreSQL stores the main application data such as logs, tenants, and user sessions, with indexes for efficient queries.

### 4. Application Layer
- **Backend API**: The backend API handles authentication using JWT, applies RBAC rules for Admin and Viewer roles, and exposes REST endpoints for search, alert management, and log ingestion.
- **Frontend**: The React frontend provides dashboards, search and filter tools, alert management, and chart visualizations for easy analysis.

### 5.  Security & Deployment
Security is enforced through HTTPS/TLS with SSL certificates, and role-based access ensures tenants are isolated. Deployment is flexible, run it as a cloud SaaS setup using Vercel, Render, or Neon, or as a single-node appliance if needed.

### 6.  Deployment Models
There are two main deployment models. The first is a hardware appliance with Docker Compose on a VM. The second is a SaaS or cloud-based deployment, where the system is hosted on a cloud provider with HTTPS access for external testing.

### 7.  Centralized Schema Structure
![Centralized Schema](./images/schema.png)
All logs are normalized into a common schema with fields such as timestamp, tenant, source, severity, action, user, and IPs. This unified structure allows consistent search, alerting, and visualization across different log sources.

## Data Flow

### 1. Log Ingestion Flow
```
Log Source â†’ Ingestion Layer â†’ Queue â†’ Background Workers â†’ Database
```

1. **Input**: Logs arrive via various channels (syslog, HTTP, file upload)
2. **Validation**: Format validation and basic parsing
3. **Queuing**: Logs queued for background processing
4. **Processing**: Workers parse, enrich, and route logs to appropriate tenant
5. **Storage**: Processed logs stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing

### 2. Search & Retrieval Flow
```
User Query â†’ Cache Check â†’ Database Query â†’ Results Processing â†’ Response
```

1. **Query**: User submits search query through frontend
2. **Cache**: Check Redis for cached results
3. **Database**: Query PostgreSQL with optimized indexes
4. **Processing**: Format and aggregate results
5. **Response**: Return infinte scrolling results

### 3. Alerting Flow
```
Log Processing â†’ Rule Evaluation â†’ Alert Trigger â†’ Notification Dispatch
```

1. **Rule Evaluation**: Each log checked against tenant's alert rules
2. **Trigger**: Matching conditions trigger alert creation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam with configurable limits
4. **Dispatch**: Send notifications via configured channels

## Tenant Model

The LMS uses a **shared database with tenant isolation**:  

- Every table includes a `tenant` field  
- Logs, users, and alerts are always stored with tenant IDs  
- **Row-level security** and **application filters** ensure users only access their own tenantâ€™s data  
- Admins can view all tenants, while standard users (VIEWER) only see their own  

### Prisma Schema (Tenant-Aware Models)
- **User**: Linked to tenant, with role (ADMIN/USER) and status  
- **Log**: Contains `tenant`, metadata fields, severity, and raw JSON  
- **AlertRule**: Configurable per tenant, unique by name within a tenant  
- **Alert**: Stores triggered alerts with tenant and rule reference
